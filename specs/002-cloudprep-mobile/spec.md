# Feature Specification: CloudPrep Mobile

**Feature Branch**: `002-cloudprep-mobile`  
**Created**: February 12, 2026  
**Last Updated**: February 15, 2026 (Phase 2 user stories added)  
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete + Phase 2 Planned  
**Input**: CloudPrep Mobile - AWS Cloud Practitioner exam preparation mobile app

## Overview

CloudPrep Mobile is a paid mobile application designed to help users prepare for the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification exam. The app provides realistic exam simulations, targeted practice sessions, comprehensive review capabilities, and performance analytics—all optimized for mobile learning.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Take Timed Exam Simulation (Priority: P1)

As an exam candidate, I want to take a full-length timed exam that mimics real AWS exam conditions so that I can assess my readiness and experience the pressure of the actual exam.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition—users purchase the app primarily to simulate real exam conditions. Without this, the app provides no differentiated value over free flashcard apps.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by launching an exam, answering 65 questions within the time limit, and receiving a pass/fail result with score breakdown by domain.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user starts a timed exam, **When** the exam begins, **Then** a 90-minute countdown timer starts and 65 questions are presented following AWS domain weighting.
2. **Given** an exam is in progress, **When** the user navigates between questions, **Then** their answers are auto-saved and they can flag questions for review.
3. **Given** the timer expires or user submits early, **When** the exam ends, **Then** a score is calculated and displayed with pass/fail status (passing threshold: 70%).
4. **Given** an exam is interrupted (app closed, phone call), **When** the user returns within 24 hours, **Then** they can resume from where they left off with remaining time preserved.

---

### User Story 2 - Practice by Domain (Priority: P1)

As an exam candidate, I want to practice questions filtered by specific AWS domains so that I can focus on my weak areas and improve targeted knowledge.

**Why this priority**: Domain-focused practice is essential for effective study—users need to address weak areas identified in their exam results. This directly supports learning outcomes.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting a domain (e.g., "Cloud Concepts"), completing a practice session, and seeing immediate feedback on each question.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user selects a domain to practice, **When** the session starts, **Then** only questions from that domain are presented.
2. **Given** a user answers a practice question, **When** they submit their answer, **Then** immediate feedback shows if they were correct and displays the explanation.
3. **Given** a user is in practice mode, **When** they want to stop, **Then** they can end the session at any time and see their session summary.
4. **Given** a user selects difficulty filter, **When** the session starts, **Then** only questions matching both domain and difficulty are presented.

---

### User Story 3 - Review Exam Results (Priority: P2)

As an exam candidate, I want to review my completed exams with explanations so that I can understand my mistakes and learn from them.

**Why this priority**: Review mode transforms a testing tool into a learning tool. Users retain more when they understand why answers are correct or incorrect.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing an exam, entering review mode, and viewing explanations for each question with correct/incorrect indicators.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has completed an exam, **When** they enter review mode, **Then** all questions are displayed with their answers marked correct or incorrect.
2. **Given** a user is reviewing a question, **When** they view the explanation, **Then** the correct answer is highlighted with a detailed explanation of why it is correct.
3. **Given** a user is reviewing results, **When** they filter by "incorrect only", **Then** only questions they answered wrong are displayed.
4. **Given** a user is reviewing, **When** they view domain breakdown, **Then** they see their score per domain with identification of weakest areas.

---

### User Story 4 - Track Performance Over Time (Priority: P2)

As an exam candidate, I want to see my performance history and progress so that I can gauge improvement and identify persistent weak areas.

**Why this priority**: Progress visualization motivates continued study and helps users make informed decisions about when they are ready to take the real exam.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by taking multiple exams/practice sessions and viewing aggregated performance charts showing trends over time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has completed multiple exams, **When** they view analytics, **Then** they see a score trend chart showing improvement over time.
2. **Given** a user views domain analytics, **When** data is displayed, **Then** each domain shows average performance with visual indicators (strong/moderate/weak).
3. **Given** a user has practice session history, **When** they view their dashboard, **Then** they see total questions answered, average accuracy, and time spent studying.
4. **Given** a user has weak domains identified, **When** they view recommendations, **Then** suggested practice areas are highlighted based on performance data.

---

### User Story 5 - Manage Questions (Admin) (Priority: P3)

As an admin, I want to create, edit, and manage exam questions so that the question bank stays accurate, current, and high-quality.

**Why this priority**: Content management is essential for long-term app value but does not directly impact the initial user experience. Can be handled via a separate admin interface or web portal.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging into admin panel, creating a question with all attributes, submitting for approval, and verifying it appears in the exam pool.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an admin accesses the question management system, **When** they create a new question, **Then** they can specify text, type, domain, difficulty, correct answer(s), distractors, and explanation.
2. **Given** a question is created, **When** it is saved, **Then** it is marked as "pending" until explicitly approved.
3. **Given** an approved question exists, **When** an admin edits it, **Then** changes are saved and the question remains in the active pool.
4. **Given** a question needs removal, **When** an admin archives it, **Then** it no longer appears in new exams but historical data is preserved.

---

### User Story 6 - Google Sign-In (Authentication) (Priority: P2)

As an exam taker, I want to sign in with my Google account, so that my exam progress syncs across devices and persists on the backend.

**Why this priority**: Cross-device sync enables users to continue their progress on different devices and provides data durability beyond app reinstalls.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by tapping "Sign in with Google" on app launch, completing the OAuth flow, and verifying exam data syncs to the backend.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user opens the app for the first time, **When** they tap "Sign in with Google", **Then** the Google OAuth flow completes successfully.
2. **Given** the user authenticates with Google, **When** authentication completes, **Then** backend creates or retrieves User record in Prisma with Google ID.
3. **Given** authentication is successful, **When** the flow completes, **Then** JWT token is returned and stored securely in AsyncStorage.
4. **Given** a user is signed in, **When** they make API requests, **Then** their User ID is automatically included for backend tracking.

---

### User Story 7 - Exam History Persistence (Priority: P2)

As a signed-in user, I want my exam attempts saved to the cloud backend, so that I can see my progress history even after reinstalling the app.

**Why this priority**: Backend persistence transforms the app from a single-device tool to a cross-device learning platform, enabling account portability and data durability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by taking an exam while signed in, verifying POST to backend completes, then checking that history persists after app reinstall.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user completes a timed exam while signed in, **When** they submit exam results, **Then** results POST to `/exam-attempts` endpoint with all exam data.
2. **Given** exam data is submitted, **When** the POST succeeds, **Then** ExamAttempt record is created in Prisma with userId, score, pass/fail, time spent, and answers array.
3. **Given** an offline exam submission, **When** the user is offline, **Then** exam is queued locally and syncs when connectivity resumes.
4. **Given** a user switches devices or reinstalls, **When** they sign into the same Google account, **Then** they can retrieve all historical exam attempts via GET `/exam-attempts`.

---

### User Story 8 - Analytics Dashboard Sync (Priority: P2)

As a signed-in user, I want to view my exam statistics from the cloud backend, so that I can track my learning progress across devices with real-time data.

**Why this priority**: Centralized analytics enable data-driven learning insights and motivate continued practice through progress visualization.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by taking multiple exams while signed in, then viewing analytics screen which displays server-calculated statistics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has completed multiple exams while signed in, **When** they navigate to analytics, **Then** the app fetches aggregated statistics via GET `/exam-attempts/analytics`.
2. **Given** analytics data is retrieved, **When** the response loads, **Then** dashboard displays total attempts, overall pass rate, average score, and average time per exam.
3. **Given** user has completed exams of multiple exam types, **When** analytics loads, **Then** breakdown by exam type (AWS CCP, SAA, etc.) is displayed separately.
4. **Given** user is viewing analytics, **When** recent exam attempts section loads, **Then** list displays last 10 exam attempts with date, exam type, score, and pass/fail status.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user answers a question but loses network connectivity during exam mode?
  - Answer: Exams run fully offline; answers are stored locally and synced when connectivity resumes.
- How does the system handle a user attempting to resume an exam after 24 hours?
  - Answer: The exam attempt is marked as abandoned and scored based on answers submitted; user can start a new exam.
- What happens if a user completes an exam but there is a sync failure?
  - Answer: Results are stored locally and displayed immediately; background sync retries automatically.
- How does the system handle questions with multiple correct answers when user selects partial answers?
  - Answer: For multiple-choice questions, all correct options must be selected for full credit; partial credit is not awarded.

- What happens when the question bank has fewer than 65 approved questions?
  - Answer: The app notifies admin; exams cannot be generated until minimum question threshold is met per domain.
- What happens if a user logs out and logs back in?
  - Answer: User data is linked to Google ID; logging back in with same account restores access to all previous exam history.
- How are exams taken offline handled when the user signs in later?
  - Answer: Offline exams remain stored locally with device-level analytics; signed-in exams are synced to backend immediately upon completion or when connectivity returns.

## Clarifications

### Session 2026-02-12

- Q: How should user data and progress be identified and persisted across device changes or reinstalls? → A: Device-only storage; no cross-device sync; data lost on reinstall.
- **[UPDATED]**: Clarification now outdated for authenticated users - see new user stories 6-8 for cloud sync capability.

- Q: What backend architecture supports question bank updates while keeping user data local? → A: Simple cloud API serves question bank snapshots; no user data stored remotely; content delivery only.
- Q: What are the performance targets for app responsiveness? → A: App launch under 3 seconds; screen transitions under 300ms; question rendering under 100ms.
- Q: What database technology should power the backend question bank API and admin portal? → A: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM.
- Q: What is the business model and monetization strategy? → A: One-time purchase on Play Store (₱149–₱299); no subscriptions; single exam per app; content quality is the competitive moat; replicable architecture for future certifications.
- Q: How should the backend support multiple exam types (e.g., AWS CCP, Solutions Architect)? → A: Multi-tenant backend with ExamType entity; one shared REST API serves all exams; one admin portal manages all question banks; each mobile app requests questions filtered by its exam type.
- Q: How should each mobile app identify its exam type when calling the API? → A: Hardcoded exam type ID in app config (e.g., `EXAM_TYPE=aws-ccp`); each app is published separately with its own config.
- Q: How should domain categories be handled across different exam types? → A: Domains defined per ExamType; each exam has its own domain list (names, weights, question quotas) stored in the ExamType entity; mobile app receives domain config during sync.
- Q: What are the minimum character counts for question quality validation (FR-025)? → A: Question text minimum 20 characters; explanation minimum 50 characters; at least 4 answer options for choice questions.
- Q: What happens on first app launch before question bank is cached? → A: App ships with bundled question bank for immediate offline use; background sync fetches updates when online.
- Q: What is the practice session question ordering and limit? → A: Questions presented in random order; sessions are unlimited (user ends manually).
- Q: How is "time spent studying" calculated? → A: Sum of active exam time (start to submit) plus practice session durations; tracked per session.
- Q: What does analytics show when user has zero completed exams? → A: Empty state message encouraging user to take first exam; no charts displayed.
- Q: Is the 24-hour exam resumption window from exam start or last activity? → A: From exam start time (expiresAt = startedAt + 24 hours).
- Q: What are the domain strength thresholds? → A: Strong = 80%+; Moderate = 70-79%; Weak = below 70%.
- Q: What happens if user tries to start new exam while one is in-progress? → A: App prompts to resume existing exam or abandon it; cannot have two concurrent exams.
- Q: How is duplicate question detection implemented? → A: Exact text match (case-insensitive) on question text field; admin is warned before saving.

## Assumptions

- Users have purchased the app through Google Play Store and have a valid license.
- The device has sufficient local storage for the question bank (estimated under 50MB).
- Admin access is handled through a separate web-based admin portal, not within the mobile app.
- Initial question bank is seeded before app launch with at least 200 approved questions.
- AWS Cloud Practitioner exam format (65 questions, 90 minutes, 70% passing) remains stable.
- Users can optionally sign in with Google to enable cross-device sync and cloud persistence (new requirement).
- Users accept offline-first architecture where exams and practice work fully offline; cloud sync is optional for signed-in users.
- Question bank updates (FR-027) apply to all users regardless of authentication status; exam history sync is auth-dependent only. Phase 1 unsigned-only functionality unchanged.
- Unsigned users: exam progress and history stored locally only; data lost on reinstall (backward compatible).
- Signed-in users: exam history and analytics synced to backend; full data recovery after app reinstall (new requirement).
- Question bank updates are delivered via a lightweight cloud API; the app polls for updates when online.
- Backend API and admin portal use PostgreSQL as the database with Prisma ORM for data access.
- Backend is multi-tenant: one shared API and admin portal manages questions for all certification exams; each mobile app filters questions by its exam type.
- Google OAuth tokens are securely stored and refreshed automatically; token expiration handled gracefully.
- Server-side analytics calculated from ExamAttempt records; real-time aggregation for performance updates.
- Future exam apps (e.g., AWS Solutions Architect) will share the same backend infrastructure and auth system.

## Clarifications

### Session 2026-02-15 (Phase 2 Consistency Review)

- **Q**: What is the exact exponential backoff sequence for offline exam sync retries? → **A**: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s (capped), maximum 12 attempts (~63 minute window before marking failed).
- **Q**: How long should JWT access vs refresh tokens be valid? → **A**: Access tokens 1 hour expiry (short-lived), refresh tokens 7 days expiry (long-lived).
- **Q**: Should T139 (sync processor) automatically trigger when connectivity restores? → **A**: Yes, auto-triggered by onConnectivityChange() state transition from offline→online (T137 dependency).
- **Q**: Does T112 (User model) require a database migration? → **A**: Yes, explicit migration `api/prisma/migrations/[timestamp]_add_user_model` should be created as part of T112.
- **Q**: How do question bank updates (FR-027) apply to Phase 2? → **A**: Question bank sync applies to all users regardless of auth; exam history sync is auth-dependent only. Phase 1 unsigned-only functionality unchanged.
- **Q**: Who owns unit tests for auth services (T113, T114, T115, T133, T131)? → **A**: Service unit tests written as part of implementation tasks (T113, T114, T115, etc.) and verified in T143 E2E auth flow test.
- **Q**: How does offline/online fallback work in CloudAnalyticsScreen (T142)? → **A**: Fetch /exam-attempts/analytics when online, display cached local analytics if offline, show 'Sync to cloud' button when connectivity restored.
- **Q**: What does ExamAttempt.syncStatus enum mean for each value? → **A**: pending = queued locally not yet sent, synced = successfully persisted on backend, failed = backend received but processing error.
- **Q**: Are T137 and T138 parallelizable? Can T140 run in parallel? → **A**: T137 and T138 can parallelize (different files, no dependencies); T140 depends on both T137 and T138 completion.
- **Q**: How is "aggregation" performed in Analytics Service (T124)? → **A**: Synchronous server-side aggregation via Prisma queries on-demand at endpoint (not pre-calculated).

## Out of Scope

- Multiple exam types within a single mobile app (each app is dedicated to one certification)
- Subscription or in-app purchase monetization models
- Social features (leaderboards, sharing, multiplayer)
- User account creation or authentication (app purchase = full access)
- Web or desktop versions of the application
- Integration with external learning management systems
- Flashcard or study note features
- Audio or video content
- Accessibility features (screen readers, high contrast) - future enhancement
- Internationalization/localization - English only for v1
- Adaptive question ordering based on user performance
- Encryption of local SQLite database (device security is sufficient)
